# Overview  
Transform the existing TypeScript monorepo template from a rigid boilerplate into a flexible, feature-driven template system. The current template requires users to run setup scripts repeatedly and creates unnecessary git changes when adding new configurations. This enhancement will allow developers to selectively enable features, customize their setup, and maintain clean git history while building upon a solid foundation.

The target audience includes developers who want to start new TypeScript monorepo projects with varying requirements - some need simple setups, others need comprehensive tooling, and many want to gradually add features as their project grows.

# Core Features  
## 1. Feature Flag System
- Conditional inclusion of tools and configurations based on user selection
- Runtime detection of enabled features to avoid unused dependencies
- Clean separation between core template and optional enhancements

## 2. Template Parameterization Engine
- Enhanced placeholder replacement system beyond just project names
- Support for nested configurations and conditional content
- Template inheritance for different project types (web-only, API-only, full-stack)

## 3. Interactive Setup Wizard
- CLI-based feature selection during initialization
- Preset configurations for common use cases (startup, enterprise, open-source)
- Progressive enhancement - ability to add features to existing projects

## 4. Modular Configuration System
- Self-contained feature modules with their own dependencies and configs
- Automatic integration of feature-specific scripts and commands
- Clean removal of features without leaving orphaned configurations

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- **Solo Developer**: Wants minimal setup, can add features later as needed
- **Team Lead**: Needs comprehensive tooling from start, enterprise-grade configurations
- **Open Source Maintainer**: Requires documentation, CI/CD, and community tools

## Key User Flows
1. **Initial Setup**: Choose template type → Select core features → Configure project details → Generate clean project
2. **Feature Addition**: Run feature addition command → Select new features → Automatically integrate with existing setup
3. **Template Maintenance**: Update template → Regenerate configurations → Clean merge of changes

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clear feature descriptions with pros/cons
- Dependency visualization (Feature A requires Feature B)
- Preview of what will be generated before confirmation

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
1. **Feature Registry**: JSON-based feature definitions with metadata, dependencies, and file templates
2. **Template Engine**: Enhanced version of current setup.js with conditional logic and template inheritance
3. **Configuration Manager**: Handles feature integration, dependency resolution, and conflict detection
4. **CLI Interface**: Interactive prompts and command-line flags for feature management

## Data Models
- Feature Definition: id, name, description, dependencies, conflicts, templates, scripts
- Project State: enabled features, configuration overrides, custom parameters
- Template Manifest: file mappings, placeholder definitions, conditional inclusions

## APIs and Integrations
- Git integration for clean commit history and branch management
- Package manager integration (pnpm) for dependency management
- CI/CD integration for template testing and validation

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Backward compatibility with existing template structure
- Support for template versioning and migration
- Feature testing framework to ensure combinations work correctly

# Development Roadmap  
## Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Implement feature registry system with basic feature definitions
- Enhance setup.js to handle conditional feature inclusion
- Create 3-5 core feature modules (linting, testing, Docker, CI/CD, database)
- Add interactive CLI for feature selection during initial setup

## Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Template inheritance system for different project types
- Feature addition to existing projects (post-initialization)
- Configuration conflict detection and resolution
- Feature dependency visualization and management

## Phase 3: Polish & Extension
- Preset configurations for common use cases
- Feature marketplace/registry for community contributions
- Advanced templating with conditional content blocks
- Migration assistant for updating existing projects

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Feature Registry** (foundation) - Must exist before any other feature work
2. **Enhanced Setup Script** - Core engine that uses the registry
3. **Basic Feature Modules** - Concrete implementations to test the system
4. **Interactive CLI** - User interface for the system
5. **Template Inheritance** - Advanced templating capabilities
6. **Post-Init Feature Addition** - Extends the system for existing projects
7. **Advanced Features** - Polish and additional capabilities

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Complex dependency management between features
  **Mitigation**: Start with simple features, build dependency resolution incrementally

- **Risk**: Breaking existing template users
  **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility, provide migration path

- **Risk**: Template conflicts and configuration overwrites
  **Mitigation**: Implement conflict detection, provide clear error messages

## MVP Scope
- Focus on 5 core features initially to prove the concept
- Maintain full backward compatibility with current template
- Ensure the enhanced system is no more complex for simple use cases

# Appendix  
## Research Findings
- Current setup.js already has placeholder replacement foundation
- Monorepo structure allows for clean feature separation
- Package.json conditional dependencies can be leveraged for optional features

## Technical Specifications
- Use JSON for feature definitions (human-readable, easily extensible)
- Leverage existing pnpm workspace structure for feature modules
- Implement feature validation to ensure working combinations
- Create feature documentation standards for community contributions
