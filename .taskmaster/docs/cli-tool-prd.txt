# Feature Registry CLI Tool - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Create a standalone npm CLI package that can add pre-defined features to TypeScript monorepo projects. This tool operates on projects created from the typescript-monorepo-template, allowing developers to quickly add common functionality like authentication, database integrations, UI components, etc.

## Core Requirements

### 1. CLI Package Structure
- Standalone npm package published as `@yourname/monorepo-features` (or similar)
- Installable globally: `npm install -g @yourname/monorepo-features`
- Command structure: `features add <feature-name>` or `features list`

### 2. Feature Registry Schema
- JSON schema defining feature structure with metadata, dependencies, conflicts
- Core fields: id, name, description, version, author, category, timestamps
- Support for file templates, npm scripts, environment variables
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Validation rules for schema compliance

### 3. Feature Definition System
- Features defined as JSON files with embedded templates
- Support for conditional content blocks based on existing project structure
- Template variables and substitution system
- Dependency management between features
- Conflict detection (e.g., can't install two auth systems)

### 4. File Template Engine
- Template files with variable substitution
- Support for multiple file types (TypeScript, JSON, config files)
- Conditional file generation based on project detection
- Merge strategies for existing files vs new files
- Directory structure creation

### 5. Project Detection & Integration
- Detect if target project is compatible (uses the monorepo template structure)
- Scan existing project to understand current features
- Integration with package.json, turbo.json, and other config files
- Preserve existing project structure and conventions

### 6. CLI Interface
Commands needed:
- `features list` - Show available features
- `features add <feature>` - Install a feature
- `features remove <feature>` - Uninstall a feature (if possible)
- `features status` - Show installed features
- `features validate` - Check for conflicts or issues
- `features init` - Initialize feature tracking in project

### 7. Feature Categories
Initial feature categories to support:
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- Database integrations (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- UI component libraries (Shadcn/ui, etc.)
- Testing frameworks and utilities
- Build tools and optimizations
- Monitoring and logging
- API documentation tools
- Security features

### 8. Installation Process
- Validate project compatibility
- Check for conflicts with existing features
- Install npm dependencies
- Generate/modify files from templates
- Update configuration files
- Provide post-installation instructions

### 9. Error Handling & Rollback
- Comprehensive error handling during installation
- Rollback mechanism if installation fails
- Dry-run mode to preview changes
- Backup mechanism for modified files

### 10. Documentation & Help
- Built-in help system
- Feature documentation and examples
- Installation guides and troubleshooting
- Contributing guide for adding new features

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Core CLI built with Commander.js or similar
- JSON Schema validation using ajv
- Template engine using handlebars or mustache
- File system operations with proper error handling
- Git integration for backup/rollback capabilities

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for schema validation
- Integration tests for feature installation
- Template rendering tests
- CLI command tests
- Test against sample monorepo projects

### Distribution
- Published to npm registry
- Semantic versioning
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and publishing
- Documentation website or GitHub pages

## Success Criteria
- CLI can successfully add features to monorepo template projects
- Schema validation prevents invalid feature definitions
- Template engine correctly generates files with proper variable substitution
- Conflict detection prevents incompatible features from being installed
- Users can easily discover and install features with simple commands
- Tool integrates seamlessly with existing project development workflow
